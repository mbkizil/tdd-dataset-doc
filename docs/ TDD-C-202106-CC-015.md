# EXAMS


Exams ([Eχαμs](https://github.com/mhardalov/exams-qa)) dataset is presenting a new benchmark for multilingual and cross-lingual question answering. 
## Dataset Details

This dataset contains 24,143 questions with their choices in total from 16 languages. The questions are high-quality high school exam questions from subjects such as Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Arts, etc. 

Cross-lingual samples are obtained by gathering parallel examinations. Some exams in the dataset were offered in several languages in some countries. There are 9,857 parallel question pairs across seven languages. 

The structure of the questions is as given in the samples. Stem of the question is given as a string and choices are a list with their labels such as "A", "B". Correct answers are given in 'answerKey', and 'info' contains the grade, subject, and language information.
